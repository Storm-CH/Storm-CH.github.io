        <p>
          Trains crossing the tracks at several intersections in Columbia, SC, 
          are causing delays for students trying to get to class on time. 
          Students are having to leave for class earlier, miss classes, 
          or cut into their study time or sleep due to the unpredictable crossing times.

            We broke our ideas up into five seperate categories. The first being solutions,
            in which we, well, came up with solutions to the problem. The second
            was implementation, which was where we put how the solutions would be 
            used. The third was design, where we put how we would design the solutions.
            The fourth was misc, which was where we put genereal ideas or thoughts.
            Finally, the fifth was hurdles, which was all the problems we thought of for
            our solutions.
